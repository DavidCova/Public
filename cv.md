## David Cova
# **Intro**
With a passion for coding, I'm a full stack web developer well tested in various
multimedia fields such as image manipulation, video and sound editing, 3D modeling as
well as video game design. I've launched two mobile video games where I developed all
code and assets, putting together my know-how in most of the fields mentioned above.
I'm currently working as a backend developer creating internal APIs that are consumed by mobile applications.
